            Hello, my name is Zach Dubay and I am a senior at Michigan State University studying Media and Information with a focus in Human Centered Technology. 
            I am from a small town called Essexville, Michigan which is located on the east side of Michigan near the Saginaw Bay. I have one older sister, 
            an MSU alum located in Boston, sadly do not have any pets at the moment and I enjoy visiting northern Michigan.
            I started out my undergraduate studying Computer Science for my first five semesters here at MSU. Though I switched out of the program, I still 
            enjoy learning to code in new languages. This is my first time working with html and Iâ€™m excited to learn more about the capabilities of HTML. 
            In the past I have had experience working with the following:
            <ul>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>C++</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </main>
