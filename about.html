                Hello, my name is Zach and I am a senior at Michigan State University studying Media and Information with a focus in Human Centered Technology. I am from a small town called Essexville, Michigan which is located on the east side of Michigan near the Saginaw Bay. I have one older sister, an MSU alum located in Boston, sadly do not have any pets at the moment and I enjoy visiting northern Michigan. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I started out my undergraduate studying Computer Science for my first five semesters here at MSU. Though I switched out of the program, I still enjoy learning to code in new languages. This is my first time working with html and Iâ€™m excited to learn more about the capabilities of HTML. 
                In the past I have had experience working with the following:
                <ul class = "languages">
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>C++</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </main>
    </body>
