            <p>Fall is upon us, which means a new Apple iPhone release is on the way. The launch date for the new iPhone 12 is this week on October 13th. 
                Though Apple is on a consistent schedule for hardware releases, the upgrades that come are not so consistent. It feels as though every few 
                years there is a major jump in technology between devices, and this year just may be the year. The past few upgrades from the X, to the XR 
                to the 11 Series hasn’t shown many notable upgrades. The main upgrade throughout these models has been both the front and rear viewing 
                cameras, with an addition of a second lens on the iPhone 11. Besides the camera, the upgrades have been minimal: battery strength, 
                a new chip, and slight RAM increase. Heck even the iPhone 11 and the XR have the same exact dimensions.</p>
            <p>The full announcement of the iPhone 12 line will be announced on the 13th of this month. From the information leaked and rumors across the 
                internet, it looks like the iPhone is getting a major upgrade with the release of the iPhone 12. It is likely that 5G will be available on 
                the iPhone 12 line, which will allow for faster data speeds for years to come. The body of the iPhone is rumored to be getting a redesign 
                as well. It is said that the edges of the device will have flat edges as opposed to the current round shape. You can see this design on the 
                iPhone 4, iPhone5, and current iPad Pro models. Personally I loved the feel of the iPhone 5 back in high school and will be excited to see 
                the return. It is expected that all of the iPhone 12 line will feature OLED screens, replacing the current LCD screens. There is a possibility 
                of a 120Hz refresh rate as well, but if offered I would expect them to only be on the Pro models.</p>
            <p>Apple is also releasing four different models so you can choose the right one for you. Taking a look at all of the possible upgrades coming to 
                the iPhone, I don’t see how you could go wrong with upgrading.</p>

            <h2>Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5?</h2>

            <p>Ah, the console war between Microsoft and Sony has been going on for decades, ever since the release of the original Xbox. Microsoft released 
                the original Xbox in 2001 to compete with Sony’s PlayStation 2, which was released a year earlier in 2000. Ever since then, it has been a 
                constant battle between the companies to produce the best tech available for their consumers. Over the years, many gamers have grown connected 
                with one system. With loyalty aside, let’s look at the technology inside of the next gen Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5.</p>
            <p>When looking at performance specs, both machines are very powerful, but the Xbox Series X has the slight upper hand on paper. Each device 
                will cost the same retail value of about $500. Both consoles will support backwards compatibility.</p>    
            <p>Looking at the PlayStation 5, it is said that it will support 8K gameplay, 120Hz refresh rate at 4k, 3D audio, and a very high end GPU. 
                Their new controller will use haptic feedback as well. The PS5 will require much less energy to run than the current model.</p>  
            <p>For the Xbox Series X, the upgrades are plentiful. The new console will be four times stronger then the Xbox One X, which is currently 
                the strongest console on the market. The backwards compatibility is not just for games, but Xbox One accessories as well.</p>  
            <p>Each console has specific games that are exclusive to the system, so that has an effect on the decision as well. Both systems are great 
                options and each will perform extremely well. The decision this year mostly comes down to preference; which games you play, what console 
                your friends have, there are a lot of factors. Preferences aside, when looking under the hood, the Xbox Series X comes out on top.</p>
